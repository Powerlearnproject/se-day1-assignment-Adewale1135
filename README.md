Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the designs,development, testing, 
and maintainance of software applications.
software engineers apply engineeringprinciples and knowledge of programming language to build software solutions
for end users.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
buiding and leading a high performing development team;this involve recruiting top talent,fostering an environment
of collaboration and continuos learning,and effective managing and motivating the team
Delivering software project on time and within budget; successful managers are able to effective plan,estimate, andexcecute 
software projects.
fostering a culture of innovation;encouraging the team to explore new technologies,experiment with nobel approaches,and countinuous look for ways to improve the products.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planning;in this phase the project lead to defining project purpose and desired result.
Requirement;the project lead analyses the product or client goals and decides on the features to aim for as a final goal
Design and prototype; this involve designing the software
Software development during this phase developer start programing
Testing; developer start running and trsting code
Deployment; the team ensures that the software is up to date
MAINTENANCE

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Agile is flexible and iterative,emphasizing continuous feedback and adaptation. waterfall is sequential and rigid, with distint phase completed in order. agile promote ongoing collaboration while waterfall focuses on thorough planning and excecution in predeterminr stages.agile example scrum,eXtreme programming while waterfall is construction of a building 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer use programing and design knowledge to build software that meets the needs of users
QAE;DESIGN and develop the QA management systems and tools of an organization
PM; responsible for planning, excecution and successfully completing projects within the allotted timeline and budget


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each. 
source code editor, build automation,and debugger VCS INVOLVES software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
capital software engineers faced capital problem due to lack of funds


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit test; unit test are very low level and close to the source of an application. they consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, component or modules used by software  unit test are generally quite cheap to automate and can run very quickly
INTERGRATION test verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together e.g it can be testing the interactions with the database or making sure that micro service work.
ACCEPTANCE testing are formal test that verify if a system satisfies business requirements.they require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is the process where you guide generative ai solutions to generate desired output 
its important to generate precise good, clear  response from AI


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
is lagos the capital city of nigeria or Abuja 
what is the capital city of nigeria
